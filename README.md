## Repository description
- `Fisher.ipynb` is the main jupyter notebook.

The following notebooks are supplemental.
- `hsc3x2pt.py` is the python script.
- `prepare_Cl_[...].ipynb` is notebook to prepare C(l). It takes time to compute C(l) because of unoptimized numerical integration binning.
- `hot_to_twoPCF.ipynb` summarizes how to use `pk2cl_class`.
- `how_to_coavriance.ipynb` summarize how to compute covariance.
- `how_to_signal_covariance.ipynb` summarizes how to compute signal and covariance.

## Todo list
- binave implementation
